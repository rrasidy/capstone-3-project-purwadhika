Project Introduction
This project, titled Capstone 3, focuses on predicting car prices in the used car market in Saudi Arabia. The dataset used includes various car attributes such as car type, region, make, gear type, origin, options, year, engine capacity, mileage, and negotiable status. The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict car prices based on these features.

The project explores multiple models including:

Random Forest
Gradient Boosting
XGBoost
Stacking Regressor

After comparing the performance of these models, Stacking Regressor and XGBoost were identified as the most promising approaches for delivering accurate predictions. The best model was saved for further implementation.

Key Objectives:
- Provide an accurate prediction of used car prices based on key features.
- Identify potential cars with negotiable prices to help maximize profit margins.
- Support Syarah.com in improving its pricing strategy for the used car market

Recommendation:
- Implement the best model, either Stacking Regressor or XGBoost, as the primary tool for predicting car prices.
- Focus on identifying cars with negotiable prices for better profit opportunities.
- 
With this approach, the project aims to enhance the accuracy of price predictions in the competitive used car market, leading to better profitability and customer satisfaction.
